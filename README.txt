Jackson Isenhower VR Project 2

Final version deployed on Quest 2B.
Should be using the same default controls as the VR template scene (forward right analog to teleport, side analog trigger to grab objects, face buttons to bring up UI).

Basketballs can be grabbed and thrown into the hoop to score points.
Points can only be scored through basketballs falling through the hoop, not being in a zone around it or by bouncing through the bottom (unless it falls back through after).
The cube at the side of the hoop area can be grabbed to reset the timer and score, which does not reset the high score count on the opposite wall.

The default cubes can be grabbed, as well as fruit from previous project.
